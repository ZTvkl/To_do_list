# To_do_list
making a To do list with python by using tkinter 
This is a Todolist created by me by using tkinter and pickle modules.
You can add tasks,delete task,upload existing tasks,save tasks,know the number of existing tasks and delete all of the tasks.
This code has 8 buttons overall and by clicking on each button a command is executed.
